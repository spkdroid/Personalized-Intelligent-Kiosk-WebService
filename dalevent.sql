We use our our senses to make sure we know what we need to be aware of as we move through our environment. We use this information to make sure we do not run into things (navigation), to learn about things we would like to capture or study (surveillance) and to help us know who or what we would like to socialize with (communication). Over the past 100 years, Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) technologies have improved radically with exponentially growing geospatial coverage. This is especially true over the past 35 years, the span of the authors career at Defence R&D Canada. The purpose of this talk is to provide a retrospective look at the evolution of CNS technologies as they have been used in underwater surveillance, surface vessel navigation and aircraft monitoring (with a quick foray into cyberspace.) A goal of the talk is to help identify CNS technologies and concepts that might be of interest to th! ose who want to observe and monitor other types of activity in the ocean environment beyond military tracking applications. In particular, there appears to be growing interest in tracking ï¬sh and marine mammals in oceans, lakes and rivers around the world as well as monitoring activity around marine infrastructure such as oil drilling rigs, tidal and wind turbines and underwater communication and power cables.
